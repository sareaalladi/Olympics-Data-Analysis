### The Summer Olympics: A Global Celebration of Sport and Unity
The Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, stand as the pinnacle of international sports competition, bringing together athletes from across the globe every four years. Rooted in ancient Greek traditions, the modern Olympic Games have grown to symbolize not just athletic excellence, but also unity, cultural exchange, and peace. The Summer Olympics feature a wide array of events that span across over 30 sports, including athletics, swimming, gymnastics, basketball, boxing, tennis, and more recently, sports like skateboarding and surfing. This diversity allows athletes of various talents and backgrounds to showcase their skills on a global stage. The competition is not just about medalsâ€”it celebrates perseverance, discipline, and sportsmanship.
### Project Description
The primary focus of this project will be on exploring and understanding the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovering trends and insights related to athletes, countries, and sports over the years. This dataset contains information on all medal winners from the Summer Olympics held between the 1976 Montreal Games and the 2008 Beijing Games, covering every medal awarded during that time span.
### Project Objective
The project focuses on analyzing the dataset to uncover trends in medal distribution over time. It aims to identify the most successful countries and standout athletes, highlighting their achievements across different Olympic editions. Additionally, it explores the gender distribution of events and medals to understand how participation and success have evolved for male and female athletes. To support these insights, various data visualization techniques in Python are employed, making the analysis more intuitive and insightful.
**Project steps:**
1. Data Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualizing Key Insights
4. Predictive Analysis
Beyond analysis, the project ventured into predictive modeling using logistic regression to classify whether an athlete would win a medal based on categorical inputs such as Country code, Sport, Gender, Event gender.
